            Oh, dear Caleb, how funny you are
Tore your MCL, now that's bizarre
But your antics don't end there, oh no
You like to spray olive oil, don't you know?

Into your brother Devin's hands, you say
He must be quite annoyed, in a playful way
But Pam Original has got you in stitches
It's the funniest thing you've ever witnessed

And then there's Hannah, your beloved fianc√©
She's got a teacher voice, don't you know?
She has to use it on you, from time to time
But you just keep on being hilarious and fine

Oh, dear Caleb, you bring joy and laughter
We're glad you're here, now and ever after!
